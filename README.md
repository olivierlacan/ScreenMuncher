# ScreenMuncher

It's really hard to find new professional/commercial TVs on LegendMicro.com so
Christine and I decided to make a little site scrapper that gives us back a simple
list of the TVs we care about (matching our requirements).

## Usage

- `git clone` the repo
- `cd` into the repo
- run `bundle install`
- run the script with `bundle exec ruby muncher.rb`
- give yourself a high five
